# Cab Availability Analysis and Optimization

## Project Overview
This project analyzes cab availability data to identify key service gaps and operational inefficiencies. The analysis focuses on optimizing the availability of cabs between the City and the Airport, aiming to reduce cancellations and improve revenue by addressing specific timeslots.

## Problem Statement
- **42% of time cabs were available** while **58% were not available**, leading to significant service gaps.
- **High cancellation rates** on the **City to Airport route**, especially during early mornings.
- **Late evening unavailability** of cabs on the **Airport to City route**.

## Key Findings
1. **City to Airport** route experiences high cancellation rates, especially during early mornings.
2. **Airport to City** route faces a lack of availability, particularly in the late evenings.
3. **Recommendations**: 
   - Reallocate cab resources during late evenings to improve availability at the airport.
   - Focus on reducing cancellations during peak hours for higher revenue and customer satisfaction.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib (for data analysis and visualization)
- **SQL**: Used for querying the data and identifying patterns.
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and organizing.
